@1 - Vcc
2 - Tx (uart)
3 - Rx (uart)
~4 - stop button (DIO-12)
5 - reset
*6 - DIO-4 (Fault detection, potentially)
~7 - start button (DIO-11)
8 - BKGD (?)
9 - DIO-8 (doesn't work for IO change detection)
@10 - GND
*11 - rotor brake (DIO-4)
12 - DIO-7 (Interferes with microprocessor if I try to use it as an IO input)
13 - DIO-9 (doesn't work for IO change detection)
14 - Vcc REF (?)
15 - Association pin
*16 - DIO-6 (Fault detection, potentially)
*17 - DIO-3 (Fault detection, potentially)
*18 - DIO-2 (Fault detection, potentially)
*19 - meter pulse counting (DIO-1)
20 - commissioning pin

*s need to be wired as input relays on the interface board
~s need to be wired as output relays on the interface board
@s need to be wired to power the XBee


These pins need to be set up for DIO change detection sampling:
*6 - DIO-4 (Fault detection, potentially)
*11 - rotor brake (DIO-10)
*12 - DIO-7 (Fault detection, potentially)
*16 - DIO-6 (Fault detection, potentially)
*17 - DIO-3 (Fault detection, potentially)
*18 - DIO-2 (Fault detection, potentially)
